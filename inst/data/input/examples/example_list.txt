input_ex_1					like smd, but multiple parallel spring to show preload calc
input_ex_2					a single body planar pendulum, weight force acting in z axis, constrained to 1-D rotation around x axis
input_ex_3					like ex_2, but hinge is replaced by bushing, so now with 6 dof
input_ex_5					link pendulum (like body held by a string), constrained to planar rotation around x axis, weight force acting in z axis, 2 dof
input_ex_6					like ex_5, but link is replaced by spring, so now with 3 dof
input_ex_7					a single body with torsion spring (defined between two points), constrained to planar rotation around z axis
input_ex_8					a multi-dof planar system of 3 bodies connected by 5 springs
