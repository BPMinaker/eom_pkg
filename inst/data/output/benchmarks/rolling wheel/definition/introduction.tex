\chapter*{IFToMM Benchmark Problem\\ Wheel on Tipping Table}
\section*{Problem Description}
\setcounter{chapter}{1}
The system considered is made up of two bodies, a rigid wheel that rests on a rigid table, where the table is held in place by a revolute joint at its mass centre.  The table has one degree of freedom, which is a rotation around a horizontal axis.  The wheel also has one degree of freedom; it can roll without slip on the table.  To simulate the no-slip condition, it is constrained to the table in both directions at the point of contact, which is initially the mass centre of the table.  However, the point of contact is allowed to move as the wheel rolls.  The surface on which the wheel rolls is also assumed to pass through the table's centre of mass.  A schematic diagram is shown in Figure~\ref{wheel}.

Both bodies are assumed to have equal mass, in this case chosen as $m=1$~\si{\kg}, the wheel has a radius $r=0.25$~\si{\m} and the table is treated a thin square plate with side length $l=1$~\si{\m}.  The inertias are calculated using standard expressions for thin laminar bodies.
