When $m=1$~\si{\kg}, $r=0.25$~\si{\m}, $l=1$~\si{\m}, and $g=9.81$~\si{m/s^2}:

There are four eigenvalues, including a pair of equal and opposite imaginary values, indicating an oscillatory mode.  The oscillatory root shows rotational motion of the table around its axis, with a coupling to both translation and rotation of the wheel.  Additionally, two non-oscillatory roots exist, one of which is unstable.  The unstable mode predicts the wheel rolling forward off an increasingly inclined table, as would be expected.

The results file should list the four eigenvalues.  Error can be computed as the $l^2$-norm of the difference between the benchmark and the computed eigenvalues.
